# Data-driven model reduction for pipes conveying fluid via spectral submanifolds


This repo includes the code and data for our paper on the data-driven reduction for pipes conveying fluid [1]. We perform reduction on two-dimensional spectral submanifolds (SSMs). The associated 2D reduced-order models (ROMs) enable efficient and even analytic predictions on the free and forced vibrations of the pipe systems, including periodic and quasi-periodic orbits and their bifurcations.

You are supposed to install SSMLearn first and then add misc folder here to MATLAB path. Now, you are ready to run the examples to reproduce the results in our manuscript.

In case you have any questions, you are welcome to reach me at limw@sustech.edu.cn
